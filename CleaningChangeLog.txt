Changes:
1.Removed:  Item Number, Postal Code,Description,Package Size Column


Notes:
1. 'Description' column deemed unnecessary for analysis.
2. 'Postal Code' column had no available data.


Changes:
1. Assigned "Uncategorized" to 17 rows with missing categories. 

Notes:
1. The items may have a better-suited category based on the product name and description; however, 
considering the lack of specific information and the potential for inaccuracies in automated categorization, 
the decision was made to temporarily designate them as "Uncategorized" for further manual review and refinement.


Changes: 
1. Assigned "Unknown" 564 rows with missing brands.

Notes:
1. The Brand information could be embeded in the item names for some products, but I did not have the ability to manually do that.


Changes: 
1. Removed 396 rows Items with list price of 0.

Notes: 
1. All 0 list price items are unavailable, which means that the value 0 might serve purpose such as place holder, data privacy or probably even marketing 
strategy instead of being outliers or typo. However a discussion with specilists would be required to find out.
